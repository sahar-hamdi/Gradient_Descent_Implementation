# Gradient_Descent_Implementation
Apply Linear regression with gradient descent and MSE loss function from scratch  on the following data(X , Y)
Split your dataset into 2 sets. Use 80% of your data for the training of the model and 20% of the data for the testing of the model
your Data:
x = np.arange(200)
delta = np.random.uniform(-50 , 30 , size = (200,))
y = 0.4 * x + 3 + delta
